## Overview

This Flutter application is designed to simulate a realistic rope using Flutter framework. It provides a visually appealing representation of a flexible and dynamic rope that responds to user interactions or specific scenarios.

## Features

- **Realistic Rope Simulation:** Utilizes Flutter's powerful graphics capabilities to create a visually convincing representation of a flexible rope.

- **Interactive:** Users can interact with the rope, leading to dynamic changes in its behavior, such as stretching, bending, and swinging.

- **Customization:** Easily customizable parameters for the rope simulation, allowing developers to fine-tune the appearance and behavior according to their requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the application:
